This project sets up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of a static website using Jenkins, GitHub Webhooks, and Nginx on an AWS EC2 instance. The pipeline ensures that every code change pushed to GitHub is automatically built and deployed to the Nginx web server, making the website live without manual intervention..
